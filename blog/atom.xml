        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this blogpost, I'm going to be talking about my favorite setup using Immerese for Mac. B/c yes, I just love sharing my current virtual setup, b/c living in NYC, space is at a premium, and it amazes me of the future! So yes, this is a bit braggy, but I also just hope to share for fun :)) and thanks to the people in the Immersed community Discord, who provided great advice + ideas + help in setting up my current setup.</p><p>(Image of me floating around the Earth + chatting in the Immersed discord)
<img loading="lazy" alt="immersedVR" src="/DevBlog/assets/images/immersedVR-d9ec5d10fc1e4bac4612489b5aa14462.jpg" width="1440" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><h1>First, Monitors!</h1><p>When talking to the Immersed team, I found out that the resolution of the monitors you can spawn in Immeresed is at most, 1920x1080. This is due to them using a VM to represent the screens and it just has a cap to the resolution. While, I can go down a software solution to potentially create my own virtual monitors at a higher resolution, which then gets mirrored into Immersed, I found that I could just buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Headless-Display-Emulator-Headless-1920x1080-Generation/dp/B06XT1Z9TF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4K ghost plug</a>. Which is essentially an HDMI plug that tricks your computer into thinking it has a 4K monitor, without having to actually display the image.</p><p>I think this is a cheap and great solution. I end up setting these displays to 2048x1080. Even though I can go to 4K, I find the text around the top of the bar, and other parts get way too small. So the 2K resolution, is actually a great sweet spot for me between being able to see, and also having a wide enough monitor to code.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenRes" src="/DevBlog/assets/images/screenres-e5ccbe5ebcd6663a09b7caa747e923f2.png" width="788" height="778" class="img_ev3q"></p><h1>Second! Retina and Encoding Quality:</h1><p>Retina Quality: 10
Encoding Quality: High</p><p>When talking to the Immersed team, I asked them what is retina quality in the Immersed computer app setting. I was told that: "if your original resolution is 1920x1080, then 0 will render as 1920x1080 pixel and 10 will render as 3840x2160 for retina display." So obviously, the best thing to do is to set it to 10 for higher resolution. I will say this is only possible however b/c I use a <a href="/DevBlog/blog/immersed-low-latency">wire connection using a (currently at the time of writing this) hacky unsupported method</a>, and the latency / performance hit is able to be handled.</p><p>For encoding quality, I was told: "Encoding quality really depends on contents. If there's lots of movement, higher setting will encode with better quality. It doesn't really affect for performance-wise, but it will increase data size that affect latency in slow network." B/c of this, while I could do "highest", I decided to just leave it to "high".</p><h1>Third! Connection setup:</h1><p>Using a hacky method that someone in the Immersed discord community figured out to allow connecting over a usb connection <a href="/DevBlog/blog/immersed-low-latency">that has made my life so much better when working in Immersed, bringing latency down to 1ms-5ms</a>.</p>]]></content>

Currently, all virtual workspace apps have a restriction to have to stream the display over the same wifi connection. This causes latency of 20ms-50ms depending on your wifi.</p><p>The solution would be to use a wired connection, but unfortunately, there is no official SDK from Meta's side to allow this type of data streaming connection, and thus, why all solutions, even Meta's own Workplace Horizon app, is limited to the same wifi. Maybe as more investigations is done over time, there will be new official options that emerge in the future.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="credit--solution">Credit + Solution<a class="hash-link" href="#credit--solution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As I interacted in the Immersed community, someone in it by Discord name, @OwariDa, figured out how to get a <strong>wired connection working</strong>! His <a href="https://clevcode.org/low-latency-vr-desktop-with-immersed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. His tutorial is great and has instructions for Window / Mac / Linux, but I just want to write a bit more organized about the Mac side of it and my own finding + following another <a href="https://discord.com/channels/428916969283125268/930540280380268564/1035372771569574038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord user's instructions README in the Discord server</a>, @woodland, who was able to build ontop of OwariDa post. Please highly recommend, also refer to these other instructions if needbe.</p><p>But what I hope with this post is to build ontop of their instructions, maybe make it a tadbit easier to follow for mac, and add some of my own findings.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>This approach is a hacky approach, not "officially" supported by the Immeresed team.

This is a huge improvement over the 20ms-50ms that you get with wifi.

As stated in owarida blog post, there is a different project that is able to establish a connection between your headset and computer. I'm guessing if you use this project, the only additional modification you would need to make is to change the desktop application to look at the local network (which will be part of the blog post) down below. But I couldn't get this to work personally.</p><h1>How to get a wired connection working</h1><p>Note, I highly recommend read this whole article first, as there are some gotchas!

(Note, this is from my own understanding and may not be technically correct.) But should still give you an idea.</p><p>When the client is booted up, it broadcasts packets on your wifi network. If these packets are received by the agent, then the agent will connect to the client. These packets are sent over WIFI / UDP connection. So what we need to do instead is, establish a TCP / wired connection to our computer. And then, when we click on connect to a computer, have it send these packets or request over the wire, and have the agent, respond back to the client over the wire vs trying to stream it back out over wifi. This is the gist of it. (BTW, IK that UDP/TCP are just protocols for communication and not necessarily wired/nonwired connection, just saying that these are the protocols being used in these instances since there is some important differentiation here).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="instructions">Instructions<a class="hash-link" href="#instructions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-goal-force-the-agent-to-look-for-connections-only-on-the-computer">First goal: Force the agent to look for connections only on the computer.<a class="hash-link" href="#first-goal-force-the-agent-to-look-for-connections-only-on-the-computer" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The first step is to force the agent to look for connections only on the computer, or essentially only on your localhost.

As the mods / devs, were saying they hope to get a release soon (who knows when) to this modified agent.</li></ol><p>But the current problem is that the current publicly released agent, even when we set the forcedIPAddress to localhost, it will still try to look for connections over wifi. So the modified agent by the Immersed team, when the forcedIPAddress is set, will not look for wifi connections, thus meaning, we can force it to only look for wired connections. So I first, highly recommend, maybe wait for a release of this modified agent, or maybe the Immersed team will be kind enough to provide it.</p><ol start="2"><li>If the agent has not been released, and you want to try to do it with the publicly avaliable agent, then we can just block all UDP packets that are being streamed over the network to our computer.
